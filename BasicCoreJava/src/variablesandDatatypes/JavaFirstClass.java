/* ranges:
1. Premitives Data 8 types:
byte: 8-bit signed integer. Can hold values from -128 to 127.
short: 16-bit signed integer. Can hold values from -32,768 to 32,767.
int: a 32-bit signed integer. Can hold values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
long: a 64-bit integer. Can hold really big numbers (-2^63 to 2^63–1).
Float:
Char 
Double 
Boolean

A double variable can provide precision up to 15 to 16 decimal points 
			  as compared to Float precision of 6 to 7 decimal digits. 
			  Another significant difference between float and double is 
			  their storage requirement, double is more expensive than float. 
			  It takes 8 bytes to store a variable while float just takes 4 bytes.
